    <h1>Family</h1>
    <p>
      I come from a large family.  I grew up in Kalamazoo, Michigan.  I have an older brother and two younger sisters.  Unfortunately we are spread out across the United States.  My older brother lives with his wife and two kids in Hermosa Beach, CA.  My youngest sister lives with her husband and two kids in Whidbey Island, WA. My other sister lives in Charleston with her son.  I try to travel as much as possible to see everyone!
